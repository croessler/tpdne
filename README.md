# Image Downloader for thispersondoesnotexist.com
This is a simple bash script that downloads images from https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com. In very short intervalls (it appears to be each reload of the page but it isn't), a new image of an artificially generated face is loaded. This script uses wget to loop through a given number of times, downloading the images.
